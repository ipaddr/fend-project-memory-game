## Instructions

This is come from starter project of Udacity FEND Track that has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I've convert this project from a static project to an interactive one by modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and read some functionality detail.

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students that been modified. Therefore, I likely will not accept pull requests.
