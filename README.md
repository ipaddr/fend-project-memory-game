## Intoduction

This is come from starter project of Udacity FEND Track that has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I've convert this project from a static project to an interactive one by modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file. 

Some libraries to use are jquery and font-awesome.
